Open Source Arduino builds and codes

After finishing coding bootcamp we became a bit bored and wanted an excuse to continue learning. 
My primary goals here have always been personal. 
Though the prospect of employment entertains me I don't expect these studies to lead to a hire 
given that there are so many in the world younger, well learned, and more qualified individuals available in the field. 

For what it's worth professionally those that see this will know how I am motivated, what I am capeable of, and how I solve problems. 

I would love to be able to build these things over night but there are always limitations to how much one can learn and accomplish. 
So, I start with a project of "Play" per say, not one of some mythical career goal.
That is, build the "magic cookie" or carrot that motivates one to solve problems and expand personal education goals.  

# personal history 
Libaries were a favorite place for me when I was younger. 
I taught myself various magic tricks, juggling, guitar, and basic electronics all from simple reading materials.
My first electronics project at the age of 11 was harvesting copper wire and building electric motors. 
As a youth, other than composing music I've always been obsessed with electronics, robots, and RC modeling.
We simply didn't have the resources growing up to own such. 
Most of my "resources" were actually from a city dump. 
Although I now have collected some decent tools much of what I use here is hacked or recycled materials.
Similarly, in the past, nearly every computer I've used has been a broken hand-me-down I repaired and upgraded myself. 

The following are a series of projects and edits on my journey to learn. 
Although most of this will be reinventing the wheel to some extent 
and will be based upon resources and workes collected online I hope some 
may find the code and process useful for personal study.  

I will try my best to display my process so that others may benefit from my experiences. 
In terms of professional projects and judgements mind ya some of these things I am learning for the first time. 

I will be more than happy to teach others or answer questions as I gain personal knowledge.

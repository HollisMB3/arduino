Open Source Arduino builds and codes

After finishing coding bootcamp we became a bit bored and wanted and excuse to continue learning. 
As a youth other than music I've always been obsessed with robotics and RC modeling. 
We simply didn't have the resources growing up to own such. 

The following are a series of projects and edits on my journey to learn. 
Although most of this will be reinventing the wheel to some extent 
and will be based upon resources and workes collected online I hope some 
may find the code and process useful for personal study.
